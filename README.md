# CarbonCalc
Carbon calculator for offsetting carbon emissions 

This repo is the SDG/ESG development index for the Shrimps SHH Token

SHH incentivises humans to engage in environmentally friendly and ecologically sustainable acts in order to promote marine conservation and offset carbon emissions with algae farms.  SHH can be spent in participating merchants and offers a redemption platform app for holders of SHH to use the token in meaningful ways.  The goal is to provide a green economy activation engine that allows people to earn Shrimps through the earn&build program and provide a form of UBI for everyone to participate.

Our team is made up of conservation and ESG experts who have been engaged in SDGs for over 20 years.  We have a balanced team of legal, security, conservation, and marketing advisors that drives the adoption of the token forward.  Please see our lite paper for more information.

Raised funds will be used mainly to further market the token to institutions and private companies that would like to offset their carbon and environmental impact.  We believe that the use of the ocean offset carbon provides the perfect solution for nature while minimising the conflict between human activity on land and our animal neighbours struggling for survival.

The majority of the token will be locked up for people to earn through participating in the earn&build program.  Participants can earn Shrimps through simple acts such as recycling, turning off unused electronics, or volunteering in beach clean up projects to help revitalise our oceans.  SHH itself is a BEP20 token with total program supply of 210million.  It's currently soft pegged to the Hong Kong Dollar to assist merchant adoption in receiving the token for services such as restaurant meals, or products such as tumblers or fabric shopping bags.  The technical base is mainly engaged in security of keeping locked up tokens safe from any bad actors, and bridging between the shrimps platform and third party wallet apps.
